'''Given a sequence of size N, containing positive integers. You need to sort the elements of sequence using Insertion sort algorithm.
Input
User Task
This is a function problem. You don't have to take any input. You are required to complete the function insertion_sort() that takes an array seq as parameter.

Custom Input
The first line of the input denotes the number of test cases 'T'.
The first line of the test case is the size of the array.
The second line of the test case consists of array elements.

Constraints
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 10^3
1 <= A[i] <= 10^3

Sum of N over all test cases won't exceed 5 * 10^3
Output
Return Sorted list.
Example
Input:
2
5
4 1 3 9 7
10
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

Output:
1 3 4 7 9
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
